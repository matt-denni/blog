In statistics, the two most common examples of measures of centre are the *mean* and *median*.  Another (less commonly used) measure of centre is the *mode*.  In this post, I will discuss the mean and median.  

## Mean

The mean value of a series of numbers is also often called the *average*.  In mathematical notation, the mean is often denoted as $\overline{x}$.  It is calculated by adding all the numbers in the series together, and then dividing that by the number of numbers in the series.

There are a number of different forms of the mean: arithmetic, weighted, geometric and harmonic.  Generally, when most people talk about the mean without specifying a type, they are referring to the arithmetic mean, which is what is discussed below.  In a future post, I will look at the other forms of the mean (and where you might want to use them).

### Arithmetic mean

Here's an example of how one might calculate the (arithmetic) mean in R:

```{r}
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4
```

Fortunately, there is an easier way to do this.  In R, you can make use of the `mean()` function to get the same result.  In the code below, The `c()` function collects a series of values into a vector.

```{r}
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
```

We can ask R to check that both calculations return the same value by using the `==` operator, which means 'is equal to'.  If both approaches return the same value, then R will print a result `TRUE`.

```{r}
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 == mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
```

## Median

The median is the 'mid-point' in a series of values.  To calculate the median, first order all of the numbers in a series from smallest to largest.

If there is an odd number of elements in the series, then there will be one value exactly in the middle of the series.  The median can be calculated as follows:

```{r}
# This code generates 5 random integers between 1 and 100
series_odd <- floor(runif(n = 5, min = 1, max = 100))

# Sort the series from smallest to largest
series_odd <- sort(series_odd)

# Print the series
series_odd

# Find the median for an odd number of elements
series_odd[(length(series_odd) + 1) / 2]
```

The number `r series_odd[(length(series_odd) + 1) / 2]` is precisely in the middle of the series: there are two numbers below it, and two numbers above it.  

In the example above, the `length()` function returns the number of elements in the series and the `[]` are used to extract to extract the value found at a given position in the series (in this case, the median).

If there is an even number of elements in the series, then there will be *two* numbers in the middle of the series, so it's necessary to find the *mean* of these two middle values to calculate the median.  Here's an example:

```{r}
# This code generates 6 random integers between 1 and 100
series_even <- floor(runif(n = 6, min = 1, max = 100))

# Sort the series
series_even <- sort(series_even)

# Print the series
series_even

# Find the median for an even number of elements
mean(series_even[(length(series_even) / 2) + 0:1])
```

The number `r mean(series_even[(length(series_even) / 2) + 0:1])` lies halfway between the middle two numbers in the series.

The code shown above is rather verbose.  Luckily, there is a much easier way to calculate the median in R - just use the `median()` function.  Let's check that our calculations above return the same results as those returned by the `median()` function:

```{r}
series_odd[(length(series_odd) + 1) / 2] == median(series_odd)
mean(series_even[(length(series_even) / 2) + 0:1]) == median(series_even)
```

They do!  So using `median()` is a much simpler approach.  Generally, fewer lines of code makes for more robust code, so I'd definitely recommend using the `median()` function, especially since the way that the median is calculated can vary depending whether there is an odd or even number of elements in a series.

## So, which is better?

The mean is probably the most commonly used measure of centre; however, there are times when it is better to use the median.  When there are extreme values (outliers) in the data, the mean tends to get pulled away from the 'centre' and toward those values.  The same applies if the data are skewed to the left or to the right (more about this in a future post).  In these cases, it is better to use the median.
