Hi! 

My name is Matt, and I'm a data scientist. This is my work-in-progress blog which I'm planning to develop this space into a 'personal textbook' in due course.  Some of the posts you see here will focus on elementary concepts, while others will be more complex.  The idea is to provide a resource that is both helpful to those starting completely from scratch (like I did) and those who are more advanced.  Give me a shout if there's a topic you'd like to know more about.

Hope you enjoy reading, and thanks for the visit!
